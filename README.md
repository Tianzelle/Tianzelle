Once, there was a little girl. She was a bit clumsy, but she was clumsy in just the right way—a way that made her very, very lovely.

When she walked, she would always count her steps. One, two, three... and then, she would suddenly forget where she had left off. She thought about it for a moment, decided that wasn't quite right, and resolved to start counting all over again from one. She felt this was only fair—that every single step deserved to be treated with such earnest care.

One day, a cloud fell from the sky.

It wasn't a vast, towering cloud, but a tiny, soft one, much like a piece of cotton candy.

The little girl looked up for a long time until her neck grew sore, so she sat on the ground and continued to watch. She wondered: If the cloud fell down, would the sky feel cold? Would the sky notice that a little piece of itself was missing?

She felt that she ought to help.

And so, she picked up the cloud with great care. But the cloud was simply too soft; as soon as she held it, it split into two. Startled, she hurried to whisper an apology, saying she hadn't meant to do it.

The cloud wasn't angry. Instead, it slowly and gently drifted back up into the sky, as if nothing had ever happened at all.

Only then did the little girl breathe a sigh of relief. She felt she had done a very grand deed that day. Though no one had seen it, surely the sky would remember.

On the way home, she accidentally stepped into a puddle. The water splashed up with a bright “Pop!” She froze for a second, then nodded seriously, deciding that the puddle must be saying hello to her.

That night, she lay in bed, her head quite empty, yet she wasn't afraid at all. There were so many things she couldn't understand.

For instance, why [**IGCrystal**](https://github.com/IGCrystal) was always surrounded by snowflakes.

For instance, why the books of [**BayHyn**](https://github.com/BayHyn) were filled with so many words she couldn't read.

For instance, why [**Xirayu**](https://github.com/Xirayu) always dazed off into space on rainy days.

For instance, why clouds could fly, and why the stars never fell down.

It was alright that these questions had no answers.

Because this was a world where clouds could fall, where puddles said hello, and where everything was treated with earnest care.

And she really, truly loved this beautiful world.
